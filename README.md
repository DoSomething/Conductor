# Conductor #

This module is in the very earliest stages of development and at the
time of writing is not functional.

The goal is to create a module akin to [maestro](http://drupal.org/project/maestro) but built
on top of [ctools](http://drupal.org/project/ctools) with an architecture inspired by 
[views](http://drupal.org/project/views) with proper exportables support and a much higher
degree of flexibility.  The goal is to support [Rules'](http://drupal.org/project/rules)
actions and conditions, enabling an enormous amount of functionality very easily.
